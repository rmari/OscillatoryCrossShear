#Oscillatory cross shear codes for viscosity and dissipation reduction in granular suspensions

These Python scripts are all based on [pyLF_DEM](https://github.com/rmari/pyLF_DEM).

*   weaver.py: SO protocol (weaver_strobo.py is the same only outputing configurations once per cycle)
*   alternate_echo_shear.py: AO protocol
*   echo.py and echo_strobo.py: Random Organization protocol (oscillatory shear only)
